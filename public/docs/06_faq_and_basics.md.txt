## Q24: Can I stake my GSN tokens without providing compute?
**Answer:** While staking is central to the security model, the primary staking role is tied to Solvers. However, the governance aspect may allow general token holders to participate in voting.

## Q25: How does the network choose which Solver handles which job?
**Answer:** The network uses an efficient market-driven pricing mechanism that matches job requirements (e.g., specific GPU type, required latency) with available Solver capabilities.


## Q26: What is the utility of the Gensyn Token?
**Answer:** The token's utility revolves around paying for compute (fees), staking/collateral to ensure honest participation (security), and providing voting power (governance) within the DAO.

## Q27: How are Submitters charged for their training jobs?
**Answer:** Submitters pay a fee in the Gensyn Token based on the required computing power, time, and network demand.

## Q28: Where does the reward for Solvers come from?
